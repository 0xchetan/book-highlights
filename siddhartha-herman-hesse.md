## Siddhartha 
by Herman Hesse.


> Everything was a lie, everything stank, everything stank of lies, everything feigned meaning and happiness and beauty, and yet everything was decaying while nobody acknowledged the fact. The world tested bitter; life was agony.

> He wanted the self to die, to no longer be an “I”, to find peace with an empty heart.

> “What is mystic contemplation? What is an out-of-body experience? What is the cessation of breath? It is flight from one’s being, it’s a brief escape out of the agony of self-existence, it’s a momentary anesthetic against the pain and meaninglessness of life.

> I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha.

> Love can be obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, or finding it in the street, but it cannot be stolen.

> Everyone can perform magic; everyone can reach his goals, if he is able to think, to wait, and to fast.”

> “Everyone gives what he has. The warrior gives strength, the merchant gives merchandise, the teacher lessons, the farmer rice, the fisherman fish.”

> “Writing is good, thinking is better. Intelligence is good, but patience is better.

> He always seems to be merely playing with business affairs; they never fully become a part of him and they never rule over him. He is never afraid of failure; he is never upset by a loss.

> Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf that is blown and is turning around through the air, wavering and tumbling to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars: they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, and in themselves they have their law and their direction.

> He learned to pay attention closely with a quiet heart, with patience, and with an open soul devoid of passion, wishes, judgment, and opinions..

> Nothing was and nothing will be: everything is, and everything is present and has existence.”.

> ‘When someone is searching,” said Siddhartha, “then it can easily happen that the only thing his eyes see is that for which he is searching. He is then unable to find anything or let any thought enter his mind because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search. He is obsessed by a goal; searching means having a goal. But finding means: being free, open, and having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a seeker, because, in striving for your goal, there are many things that you don’t see, even though they are right in front of your eyes.”

> Wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness.

> Knowledge can be transferred, but not wisdom. It can be found and lived, and it is possible to be carried by it. Miracles can be performed with it, but it can’t be expressed and taught with words.
