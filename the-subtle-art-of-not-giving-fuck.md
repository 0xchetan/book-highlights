# The Subtle Art of Not Giving F*ck

> There’s a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest.” A confident man doesn’t feel a need to prove that he’s confident. A rich woman doesn’t feel a need to convince anybody that she’s rich. Either you are or you are not. And if you’re dreaming of something all the time, then you’re reinforcing the same unconscious reality over and over: that you are not that.

> The idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place.

> It then follows that finding something important and meaningful in your life is perhaps the most productive use of your time and energy. Because if you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.

> We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change. We have evolved to always live with a certain degree of dissatisfaction and insecurity, because it’s the mildly dissatisfied and insecure creature that’s going to do the most work to innovate and survive. We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have. This constant dissatisfaction has kept our species fighting and striving, building and conquering. So no — our own pain and misery aren’t a bug of human evolution; they’re a feature.

> An obsession and overinvestment in emotion fails us for the simple reason that emotions never last. Whatever makes us happy today will no longer make us happy tomorrow, because our biology always needs something more. A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of “something else” — a new house, a new relationship, another child, another pay raise. And despite all of our sweat and strain, we end up feeling eerily similar to how we started: inadequate.

> You can’t win if you don’t play.

> Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for.

> One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.

> We don’t always control what happens to us. But we always control how we interpret what happens to us, as well as how we respond.

> we are always choosing, whether we recognize it or not. Always.

> You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else.

> Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are.

> Be Careful What You Believe.

> Our beliefs are malleable, and our memories are horribly unreliable.

> The man who believes he knows everything learns nothing.

> Work expands so as to fill up the time available for its completion.

> The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

> Define yourself in the simplest and most ordinary ways possible.

> If every project I started failed, if every post I wrote went unread, I’d only be back exactly where I started. So why not try?

> If you’re stuck on a problem, don’t sit there and think about it; just start working on it. Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the right ideas to show up in your head.

> It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby.
